An open-source, multiplexed potentiostat kit for at-home diagnostic testing, to be used in tandem with a custom microfluidic assay

NFluidEX is based on ABE-Stat, an open-source potentiostat designed by Jenkins et al. in 2019. Their open-source publication can be accessed [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.0061909jes) for extensive documentation on the basis of its functionality.
